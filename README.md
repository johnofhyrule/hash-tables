# Hash Tables

## What is a Hash Table?
A hash function takes in a key, such as a string or integer, for a data record (often a key-value pair) and returns an integer memory address, or an index in a table where that record can be stored. In other words, it maps some key from the very large universe of possible keys to a much smaller range of possible indices in a hash table.

## Food for thought
“If I were stranded on a desert island and could only take one data structure with me, it would be a hash table.”
- Peter Van Der Linden, Author of Deep C Secrets
